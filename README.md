# 📦 Supply Chain Data Analysis Project

## 📌 Project Overview  
In this project, we analyzed a comprehensive supply chain dataset from **DataCo Global**. The dataset includes detailed information related to orders, products, shipping, customers, costs, and profits over several years.  
We used tools such as **Excel**, **Tableau**, and **Power BI** to extract insights aimed at improving operational efficiency and reducing risks within the supply chain.

## ❗ Problem Statement  
Although there is continuous production of products, the dataset reveals significant issues:

- Some products are manufactured but do not get sold.
- There are significant delays in the delivery of certain categories.
- Profits came to a complete halt in 2018 despite ongoing production.

The main problem is the **inefficient management of supply and inventory** along with **weak demand forecasting**, which ultimately impacts profitability and overall operational efficiency.

## 🔍 Key Insights  

- **High Delivery Delays:** Categories such as athletic footwear (e.g., cleats) exhibit the highest delay rates.  
- **Consistent Performance in Electronics:** Electronic products have the lowest incidence of delays.  
- **Profit Disruption in 2018:** The year 2018 saw a complete stop in profits, indicating issues in inventory or market demand.  
- **Unsold Inventory:** Some products are produced without achieving sales, leading to unnecessary costs and losses.

## ✅ Recommendations  

1. **Enhance Demand Forecasting**  
   Implement more accurate forecasting models to ensure production aligns with market demand.

2. **Improve Supplier Performance**  
   Reevaluate current suppliers and eliminate those that contribute to delays; explore alternative vendors.

3. **Optimize Inventory Management**  
   Apply “Just In Time” inventory practices and stop production of unsold products.

4. **Revise Pricing & Promotion**  
   Consider re-pricing or launching promotional campaigns for stagnant products.

5. **Analyze Anomalies in 2018**  
   Conduct deeper analysis to understand why profits stopped in 2018 and take corrective action.

## 📌 Conclusion  
This project demonstrates how data analysis can uncover critical supply chain issues and enable businesses to make smarter decisions.  
By identifying weaknesses such as delayed deliveries and unsold inventory, we proposed actionable strategies to boost **profitability** and improve **operational efficiency**.  
Ultimately, the analysis shows the value of **data-driven decision-making** in solving real-world business problems.
